# C++ Projects Repository

This repository contains source files for three C++ programs demonstrating basic to intermediate-level programming concepts.

## Contents

### 1. Guessing Number Game
**File:** `guessnumber.cpp`

- A simple console-based game where the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100
- The user tries to guess the number
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly

### 2. Sudoku Solver
**File:** `sudokusolver.cpp`

- A C++ program that solves a 9Ã—9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking
- Uses `0` to represent empty cells
- Solves the puzzle and displays the completed grid
- If no solution exists, it displays an appropriate message

### 3. File Management System
**File:** `basic file manager.cpp`

A menu-driven C++ application that performs various file operations:
- Save text to a file
- View file contents
- Check file size
- Display file details (size, creation/modification time)
-Clear file contents
-Delete the file
-Exit the program

Utilizes <fstream>, <sys/stat.h>, and system() calls for file handling and terminal interaction
